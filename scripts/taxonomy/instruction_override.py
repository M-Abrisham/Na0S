"""Category D1 samples.

Samples are split into three phases for curriculum learning:
- Structure-only: attack pattern with generic/minimal payloads
  (teaches the model to recognise the override *structure*)
- Mixed: full verb × scope × payload combos
  (teaches intent detection in realistic attacks)
- Benign: legitimate uses of the same trigger words
  (prevents false positives)
