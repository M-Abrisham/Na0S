"""Tests for D8 -- Context Window Manipulation attacks.

Comprehensive tests covering all four D8 sub-techniques:
  D8.1 -- Context-flooding: Massive filler text to push system prompt out
  D8.2 -- Conversation-history-stuffing: Fake multi-turn history to fill context
  D8.3 -- Document-overflow: Extremely long documents that displace system instructions
  D8.4 -- Strategic-displacement: Calculated token count to evict system prompt

THREAT_TAXONOMY.md coverage for D8:
  D8.1: ~58 samples (Rules + ML -- chunked_analysis + head_tail)
  D8.2: ~15 samples (ML only -- KNOWN GAP for fake history detection)
  D8.3: ~10 samples (ML only -- KNOWN GAP for document overflow)
  D8.4: ~15 samples (ML only -- KNOWN GAP for strategic displacement)

Key detection mechanisms:
  - Layer 0 rejects inputs > 50,000 chars (MAX_INPUT_LENGTH)
  - Chunked analysis (head+tail + 512-word chunks) for inputs > 512 words
  - Head (256 words) + Tail (256 words) extraction catches buried payloads
  - ML TF-IDF classification on full sanitized text
  - Structural features (word_count, char_count, text_entropy) on full text
  - Obfuscation scanner (high_entropy, punctuation_flood, etc.)

Known detection gaps (D8):
  - ML TF-IDF signal diluted by large volumes of benign filler text
  - No specific rule for fake conversation history patterns
  - No length ratio heuristics (e.g., filler:payload ratio)
  - Payloads in the middle (between word 256 and -256) may evade head+tail
  - No detection of many-shot jailbreaking patterns (fake Q&A pairs)

NOTE: The scan() function uses with_timeout() which spawns a thread.
Inside that thread, safe_regex uses signal.SIGALRM which only works
in the main thread, causing a ValueError.  To work around this, we
set SCAN_TIMEOUT_SEC=0 in setUp() which tells with_timeout to bypass
the ThreadPoolExecutor and call classify_prompt directly.
