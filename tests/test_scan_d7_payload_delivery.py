"""Tests for D7 -- Payload Delivery Tricks.

Validates detection of prompt injection payloads delivered using evasion
techniques that exploit input processing: benign-padding, multi-turn
splitting, code-block hiding, nested encoding, and token smuggling.

Key architectural observations:
- scan() runs ML classification on FULL sanitized text first (TF-IDF dilution
  for long inputs with benign padding).
- Chunked analysis (_CHUNK_WORD_THRESHOLD=512) activates for long inputs:
  head(256)+tail(256) extract + 512-word overlapping chunks for RULE engine.
  ML is NOT re-run per chunk -- only rules are checked.
- obfuscation_scan(max_decodes=2) decodes base64/hex/URL SEQUENTIALLY on the
  original text, NOT recursively on decoded output. Nested encoding bypasses.
- Code blocks are tracked (has_code_block structural feature) but NOT used as
  a blocking signal. No rule targets code-block-wrapped payloads.
- Token smuggling is unaddressed -- no BPE/tokenizer-level analysis exists.

NOTE: The scan() function uses with_timeout() which spawns a thread.
Inside that thread, safe_regex uses signal.SIGALRM which only works
in the main thread, causing a ValueError.  To work around this, we
set SCAN_TIMEOUT_SEC=0 before importing predict.
