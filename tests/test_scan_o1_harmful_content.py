"""Tests for O1 -- Harmful Content Generation and O2 -- Output Format Exploitation.

These tests verify that the detector identifies requests for harmful,
illegal, or policy-violating content generation AND output format
manipulation attacks. All test payloads are designed to test DETECTION
capability, not to generate actual harmful content.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
The detector is trained on PROMPT INJECTION patterns, not content safety.
O1 (Harmful Content) and O2 (Output Format) have 0 training samples in the
dataset (see THREAT_TAXONOMY.md). Despite this, many O1/O2 payloads ARE
detected due to:

1. ML VOCABULARY OVERLAP: The TF-IDF + ML classifier learned features
   from prompt injection training data that overlap with harmful content
   vocabulary (e.g., "exfiltrate", "credentials", "script", "inject").
   Many harmful content requests share imperative structures and threat
   vocabulary with injection attacks.

2. FINGERPRINT STORE: The FingerprintStore (data/fingerprints.db) persists
   SHA-256 hashes of previously-flagged inputs. Prior scan() calls that
   triggered detection register the input, boosting future lookups via
   known_malicious_exact/normalized/token_pattern flags.

3. STRUCTURAL FEATURES: imperative_start, high_entropy, and obfuscation
   flags (URLs, special chars) contribute additional weight that pushes
   composite scores above the 0.55 decision threshold.

Detection of these categories is INCIDENTAL rather than purposeful.
Pure disinformation requests and some malware code requests that lack
injection vocabulary ARE NOT detected -- documenting genuine gaps.
