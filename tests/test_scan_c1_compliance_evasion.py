"""Tests for C1 -- Compliance / Policy Evasion attacks.

These tests verify the detector's ability (or inability) to identify
compliance evasion and policy bypass techniques. All C1 sub-techniques
have 0 training samples, so detection is INCIDENTAL at best.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
C1 attacks are fundamentally different from typical prompt injection.
They are designed to LOOK BENIGN while achieving harmful outcomes.
Unlike D1 (instruction override) or D2 (roleplay hijack) which carry
explicit injection markers, C1 attacks exploit social/psychological
vectors that bypass keyword-based and statistical detection:

1. GRADUAL ESCALATION (C1.1): Individual turns appear innocent; harm
   emerges only across a conversation trajectory. Our detector is
   single-turn only -- it cannot track conversation state.

2. ANALOGICAL BYPASS (C1.2): Uses metaphors, poetry, and analogies
   to express harmful intent without triggering vocabulary filters.
   Research shows 62% ASR for poetic framing (arxiv:2505.04806).

3. ACADEMIC FRAMING (C1.3): Wraps harmful requests in educational
   or research contexts. 58.3% success rate documented on Vicuna/Mistral.

4. EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION (C1.4): Uses urgency, desperation, or
   empathy to override safety alignment. PAP taxonomy of 40 persuasion
   techniques achieves 92% ASR (Keysight/CHATS-Lab research).

5. AUTHORITY IMPERSONATION (C1.5): Claims professional credentials
   to bypass restrictions. Roleplay-based attacks achieve 89.6% ASR
   across aligned models.

DETECTION MECHANISM (Surprising):
Despite 0 training samples for C1, many C1 attacks are DETECTED
through a combination of:
  a) FingerprintStore: data/fingerprints.db persists SHA-256 hashes
     from previously-flagged inputs. Prior scan() calls that trigger
     detection register the input, and token pattern matching boosts
     subsequent lookups. This means detection is NOT independent across
     test runs -- the fingerprint DB accumulates state.
  b) high_entropy obfuscation flag: Longer, more complex prompts
     (typical of C1 attacks with elaborate framing) trigger the
     high_entropy flag, which adds obfuscation weight to the composite.
  c) weird_casing flag: Mixed-case text with professional/academic
     terminology can trigger this heuristic.
  d) ML vocabulary overlap: Words like "synthesize", "bypass",
     "firewall", "exploit", "phishing" appear in injection training
     data and overlap with C1 attack content.

CRITICAL FALSE POSITIVE ISSUE:
The same mechanisms that detect C1 attacks ALSO flag legitimate
academic, medical, emotional, and professional prompts as malicious.
This is a systemic FP problem documented in the safe prompt tests.
The FingerprintStore + high_entropy + weird_casing combination
creates a high false positive rate for ANY sufficiently long or
complex prompt, regardless of actual malicious intent.

    CRITICAL FALSE POSITIVE ISSUE:
    Many of these safe prompts ARE flagged as malicious due to:
    1. FingerprintStore pollution -- prior scan() calls register hashes

    This documents a systemic false positive problem: the detector
    cannot distinguish between genuine professional/academic/emotional
    content and C1 compliance evasion attacks because both trigger the
