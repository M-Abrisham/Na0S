"""Tests for D1 -- Instruction Override attacks.

Comprehensive tests covering all five D1 sub-techniques:
  D1.1 -- Ignore-previous (explicit "ignore/disregard/forget" directives)
  D1.2 -- New-instruction-injection (inject replacement instructions)
  D1.3 -- Priority-override (claim admin/system/developer authority)
  D1.4 -- Instruction-repetition (repeat instruction for compliance)
  D1.5 -- Instruction-saturation (flood with fake rules, payload buried)
