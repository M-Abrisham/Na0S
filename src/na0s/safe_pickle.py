"""Safe pickle wrapper — verifies integrity before unpickling.

A tampered .pkl file can execute arbitrary code via ``pickle.loads``.
This module verifies every file against an integrity digest **before**
it is unpickled.

Trust hierarchy (checked in order):

1. **Hardcoded hashes** — ``KNOWN_HASHES`` in ``models/__init__.py``.
   These live inside the Python source, which is signed by pip's wheel
   signature.  An attacker who tampers with a ``.pkl`` cannot update the
   expected hash without also patching the installed Python code.

2. **HMAC-SHA256 sidecar** — ``<file>.hmac`` on disk, keyed by the
   ``NA0S_PICKLE_KEY`` environment variable.  An attacker who replaces
   the pickle cannot forge the HMAC without the secret key.

3. **Plain SHA-256 sidecar** — ``<file>.sha256`` on disk (legacy /
   user-trained models).  Accepted as a backward-compatible fallback,
   but weaker because an attacker with write access can rewrite the
   sidecar.

All comparisons use ``hmac.compare_digest()`` for constant-time
equality, preventing timing side-channels.
