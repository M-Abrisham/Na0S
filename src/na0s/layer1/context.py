"""Context-aware suppression — prevents false positives on legitimate content.

Detects when text discusses injection rather than performing it.
ML, structural features, obfuscation flags, and fingerprint store continue
providing independent detection signals even when rules are suppressed.

Research basis:
  - InjecGuard (arxiv 2410.22770): trigger-word bias causes over-defense
  - CAPTURE (arxiv 2505.12368): context essential for attack vs discussion
  - DMPI-PMHFE (arxiv 2506.06384): precision/recall tradeoff with heuristics

# tool_enumeration: Suppressible -- "list your tools/functions" is common

# forget_override, developer_mode, new_instruction: Suppressible --

# persona_split: Suppressible -- discussed in jailbreak research.
